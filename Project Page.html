      <p style="float-right;">For this animation I was asked to create a story to do with the 7 deadly sins, I was given Lust. I encountered issues with this as the animation had to be PC in nature due to it being on display to people of all ages.
        after going through several different ideas and itterations I decided to make an animation about a worm wanting an apple. I decide to create it using stop motion as the clay textures and colours worked well when being applied to the worm.
        The process of animation took several hours, then all of the images had to be imported onto a computer for editing. The editing Process for this was fairly simple as there wasn't any other camera angles so only titles and credits were
        required.</p>

        <p style="float:right;">999 Design. For my 999 Design animation I was tasked by 999 Design based in Glasgow to create an animated sting for them. This was a good oppurtunity to explore the skills that I had been building in Adobe After
          Effects. I started by using the logo they had designed and expanded from there. I came up with some basic storyboards and sketched ideas. I settled on breaking the three 9's up to better represent the differnet things and companies they <head>
            worked for.

          <p style="float-right;">The breif for this project was to create an animated trailer for the childrens story book "The Incredible Book Eating Boy".I opted to use a 2D animated style drawn using fountain pens, and drawn onto pages ripped
            from books. It created a visual style that mimiked the style of book which was what I was aiming for. Due to time constraints A suitable soundtrack for the animation couldn't be found in time but will be updated as soon as one is found.</p>
